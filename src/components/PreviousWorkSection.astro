        <p class="project-summary-description">
          I helped develop wearable robotic shoes for gait rehabilitation. I designed and prototyped custom pneumatic air pockets that can adjust the stiffness of the shoe sole during walking, allowing patients to experience gait perturbations in natural environments rather than being confined to laboratory settings. The system uses flexible components and embedded sensors to maintain a lightweight, portable design.

          I investigated whether carbon-plated running shoes provide biomechanical advantages during extreme uphill walking. I designed and carried out the full study, analyzing joint kinematics across three footwear types (minimalist, standard, and carbon-plated) on inclines up to 30°. Prior to the study, I helped build a custom steep-incline treadmill system capable of adjusting from 5-40° for testing at these extreme slopes.
